# verification-MIPS-instructions-with-Questa

This project simulates and verifies a pipelined MIPS processor as well as includes design of its respective testbench. The MIPS processor has been designed with system verilog and has been simulated using Questa through a Linux virtual machine. The testbench has been designed in order to test 9 instructions which are made possible by the  simulated processor. Each instruction is read from its own unique .txt file. The result is then stored in its appropriate .txt file.
